Zebedee tunnel for Android
==============================

This package ports [http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/index.html](Zebedee) code ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/zebedee/files/jzbd/20011010](jzbd java version)) to the Android platform (all android versions since 2.1 to at least 4.4).

Zebedee is a simple program to establish an encrypted, compressed "tunnel" for TCP/IP or UDP data transfer between two systems. This allows traffic such as telnet, ftp and X to be protected from snooping as well as potentially gaining performance over low-bandwidth networks from compression. (As [http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/](stated on its web))
